# Juanito-AV-Mini-Rev-1.x
Here, I develop the Juanito AV Mini system Rev 1.x for model rockets. AV stands for avionics, and I named this first system to develop Mini because it will be small. I have the following goals with this project:

1. Have fun
2. Learn as much about the Attiny85 and microcontrollers in general
3. Design and build an avionics system as small and cheap as possible
4. Make it capable of dual deployment
5. Utilize the Attiny85 microcontroller with AVR RISC architecture
